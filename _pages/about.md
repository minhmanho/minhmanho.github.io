I am a Research Scientist/Engineer working at the intersection of generative AI (GANs, diffusion models), computer vision, and computational pathology, with practical experience deploying ML systems for face recognition and virtual try-on in production environments.

Beyond research, I have a strong passion for photography and enjoy capturing, editing, and retouching images, an interest that naturally complements my work in visual computing.

## News
