Developed LDMs with Parameter-Efficient Fine-Tuning (PEFT) and Histopathology Pre-Trained Embeddings for translating low-quality frozen section images to high-quality FFPE images, taking generative model hallucinations into account and improving classification performance from 81.99% to 94.64% AUCROC on low-quality frozen slides, while the performance on high-quality FFPE images reached 94.63%.
